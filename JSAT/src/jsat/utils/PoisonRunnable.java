/**
 * A helper class for using the reader / writer model to implement parallel algorithms. 
 * When using the a {@link BlockingQueue}, <tt>null</tt> is an invalid value. However,
 * if several threads have been started that are simply reading from the queue for 
 * jobs, we want to let the threads know when to stop. Polling can not be used since 
 * the {@link BlockingQueue#take() } operations blocks until a value is added. If 
 * the queue is a queue of {@link Runnable} jobs, this class solves the problem. 
 * An <tt>instanceof</tt> check can be done on the returned runnable. If it is a poisoned
 * one, the worker knows to stop consuming and terminate.  
 * <br><br>
 * By default, the {@link #run() } method does not perform any action. The 
 * poison runnable can be used to perform ending clean up work, such as posting 
 * to a semaphore, by giving the work job to the 
 * {@link #PoisonRunnable(java.lang.Runnable) } constructor. The runnable given 
 * will be run when the Poison runnable's run method is called.
