/**
 * ImpurityScore provides a measure of the impurity of a set of data points 
 * respective to their class labels. The impurity score is maximized when the 
 * classes are evenly distributed, and minimized when all points belong to one 
 * class. <br>
 * The gain in purity can be computed using the static <i>gain</i> methods of
 * the class. However, not all impurity measures can be used for arbitrary data 
 * and splits. Some may only support binary splits, and some may only support 
 * binary target classes.
